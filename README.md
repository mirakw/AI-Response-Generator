# AI-Powered Chatbot Workflow Using Activepieces, Webhooks, and AskAI

## Overview
This project leverages **Activepieces** to create a fully automated chatbot workflow. It integrates **webhooks** for capturing input, **AskAI** for processing natural language text, and **Bolt** for chatbot capabilities and API requests. The workflow is designed to streamline the flow of user interactions and responses using an efficient and scalable architecture.
