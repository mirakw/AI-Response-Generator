# AI-Response-Generator
This project uses Activepieces to create a chatbot workflow with webhook integration and AskAI for text processing. The flow captures user input, processes it through AskAI, and returns responses via webhook. Integrated with Bolt, it provides full chatbot functionality with API support. Screenshots included.
